- A docker-compose based implementation for demo/lab environments observing BIG-IP NEXT
- Generates CA/TLS keys (Dont do it this way in production - plenty of better key       
   management approaches)                                                                
- Runs open telemetary collector using those TLS keys - logging to a file             \                                                                            
- Grafana, Promethius, Loki Jaegar etc

TODO:
- Alert filters to find interesting things.
